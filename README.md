## Abstract
Plagiarism is the act of using another person's words or ideas in your own work without giving them proper credit. This can be done with or without the other person's consent. Plagiarism can be deemed dishonest and a violation of copyright laws. This term applies to all written, printed, and electronic works, whether published and unpublished.

For detecting plagiarism in the English language and other western languages, there are many technologies available. Despite being one of the most spoken languages in the world and being used extensively online, there is no method for identifying news article plagiarism in **Bangla.**
As a result, we have chosen to use a corpus construction strategy to create a plagiarism detection program for **_Bangladeshi news articles._**
